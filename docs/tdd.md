Okay, let's elaborate on the Test-Driven Development (TDD) aspects of the RQIB simulation implementation plan, providing a more detailed and explicit list of tests for each component. This will serve as a guide for writing the actual test code in Go. We'll focus on the core components and use Go's testing conventions (functions starting with `Test` in `*_test.go` files).

**General TDD Principles:**

*   **Red-Green-Refactor:** Write a failing test *first*, then write the minimal code to make it pass, then refactor.
*   **Small, Focused Tests:** Each test should focus on a single, specific aspect of the code.
*   **Isolation:** Tests should be independent of each other.
*   **Repeatability:** Tests should produce the same results every time they are run.
*   **Fast Execution:** Tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (ideally >90% for critical components).

This detailed breakdown of tests provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the RQIB simulation using Test-Driven Development. By writing these tests *before* writing the code, you'll ensure that the implementation meets the design specifications, behaves correctly, and is robust to various conditions and attacks. This is a significant undertaking, but the TDD approach will greatly improve the quality and reliability of the simulation. Remember to prioritize testing the core components and the most novel aspects of the framework, particularly the path integral consensus and the "no-cloning" tokens. The tests should be organized into logical groups (by component and functionality) and should be well-documented.
