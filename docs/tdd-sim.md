# **QRL Multi-Function Network: Test-Driven Development (TDD) Plan**

This document outlines the TDD strategy for developing the Quantum Resonance Ledger (QRL) network variant, focusing on its core physics-inspired mechanisms and native functionalities (**Wavefunction Stability Index (WSI)**, Voting, Bridging, Verification).

**General TDD Principles:**

*   **Red-Green-Refactor:** Write a failing test *first*, then write the minimal code to make it pass, then refactor.
*   **Small, Focused Tests:** Each test should focus on a single, specific aspect of the code.
*   **Isolation:** Tests should be independent of each other where possible.
*   **Repeatability:** Tests should produce the same results every time they are run.
*   **Fast Execution:** Tests should run quickly to provide rapid feedback.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (ideally >90% for critical components).
