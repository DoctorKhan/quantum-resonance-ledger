**QRL Multi-Function Implementation Plan (Native Stablecoin, Voting, Bridging, Verification)**

**Goal:** To launch a specialized Quantum Resonance Ledger (QRL) network variant supporting a core set of native functionalities: a dynamically adaptive stablecoin (`QUSD`), on-chain voting, cross-chain bridging, and primitives for supply chain/document verification. The system leverages QRL's physics-inspired dynamics for scalability, adaptability, and stability, operating without general-purpose smart contracts.

**Core Philosophy:** The network provides a secure and efficient foundation for a *limited set of predefined, high-value applications* implemented as core protocol features or tightly controlled "native interactions," governed by the overarching QRL dynamics.

**Core Components (Embedded or Native):**

1.  **QUSD Token:** Native QRL asset (CUT) for stable value.
2.  **QRG Token:** Native QRL asset (CUT) for governance and stablecoin mechanism participation.
3.  **Native Gas Token:** For transaction fees and network participation (if separate from QRG).
4.  **Stability Interaction Rules (SIR):** Core protocol logic for QUSD peg maintenance (as before).
5.  **Voting Module:** Native protocol feature for creating proposals and enabling QRG holders to vote securely on-chain.
6.  **Bridging Module:** Core protocol logic facilitating secure locking/unlocking/minting/burning of assets (QUSD, QRG, potentially others) for cross-chain interaction, possibly leveraging QRL's unique properties.
7.  **Verification Primitives:** Native data structures and transaction types optimized for anchoring cryptographic proofs (hashes, commitments, ZKPs) related to off-chain supply chain events or documents onto the QRL ledger for immutable timestamping and verification. (Does *not* store the full data).
8.  **Extended QRL Hamiltonian:** Incorporates terms related to QUSD stability, network load from *all* native functions, voting integrity, bridge security, and verification throughput/cost.
9.  **Protocol-Level Oracle Integration:** For QUSD stability and potentially other functions (e.g., external data triggers for verification).

**Phase 0: Multi-Function Design & Interaction Modeling (Months 1-5)**

*   **0.1.

This multi-function plan significantly increases complexity compared to the stablecoin-only approach. The core challenge lies in designing the Hamiltonian and parameter dynamics to correctly balance the potentially competing needs and resource demands of stablecoin maintenance, voting, bridging, and verification anchoring, all while leveraging QRL's unique physics-inspired mechanisms for overall network health and scalability. The restricted nature (no general smart contracts) still provides a crucial advantage in predictability and targeted optimization compared to a general-purpose L1.
